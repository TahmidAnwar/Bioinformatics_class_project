# Comparative Analysis of Different Physical Properties of Tau Protein in Normal Individual and Mutated Alzheimer's Variant 
# Description
The goal of this experiment was to determine differences between the tau protein sequences of a common wild type variant (P10636-8) and an Alzheimer's variant in homo sapiens and analyzing different physical properties of the two sequences. 
# Features
  - **tau_protein_analysis.ipynb:** contains the code that changes the three amino acids at three specific locations of the reference sequence (P10636-8) to obtain Alzheimer's mutant variant sequence, also contains the code where the pairwise alignment using clustal omega is performed between the two sequences.
    
  - **tau_protein_properties_analysis:** contains the code that outputs values of different properties such as molecular weight, isoelectric point, aromaticity, instability index, hydrophobicity of the two protein sequences.
# Tools/Packages Used:
UniProt, NCBI, Clustal Omega, ProteinAnalysis

**The codes can be found in the main branch of this repository**
